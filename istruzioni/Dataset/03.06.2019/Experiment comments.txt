Freezing-melting cycles

-2V case
RH 56.6-51.1
Tamb 21.9
no condensation during the first cooling phase
no melting processes during the first phase
no condensation during the second cooling phase
no melting processes during the second phase

Note: just small drops on the border of the plate/Peltier

-3V case
RH 55.9-48.2-46
Tamb 21.9-22

Note: just small drops on the border of the plate/Peltier
During the first iteration in the melting region small drops of ice 
turned into water drops (it can be seen from the curve T(t))
During the second cooling region the kinks are probably due to water to ice phase change
of small water drops on the borders of the Peltier


-4V case
RH 55.9-45.8
Tamb 22-22.1


Note: during the first cooling region the kinks are probably due to water to ice phase change
of small water drops on the borders of the Peltier
During the first melting cycle the phase change of droplets makes the plateau of T(t)


-5.3V case
RH 55.2-47.2-46.8-45.9-44.4
Tamb 22.1-22.2

Note: during the first cooling cycle small drops of ice form also if before it was no water drop
During both cooling cycles no evident freezing appears on the graphs but qctually small drops
on the sides of the Peltier freeze
At the end of the second cooling cycle small filaments at the border of the prepreg plate appeared
and they disappeared during the melting cycle


-6V case
RH 54.5-48.3-47.2-44.3
Tamb 22.1-22.3

Note: during the first cooling cycle small drops of ice form also if before it was no water drop
During the second melting cycle it seems that the plateau is reached when the ice "filaments" melt


-7V case
RH 50.4-45.1-44.7
Tamb 22.2-22.3

Note: by looking the first cooling cycle it seems that no ice is formed also if small 
ice drops are formed
During the second melting phase it seems that the plateau is not due to ice to water phase change 
of lateral drops (they were still present)


-8V case
RH 52.7-48.7-44.9-43.4
Tamb 22.2-22.3

Note: during the first cooling cycle a change of dT/dt is present


2 drops of normal water
-2V case
RH 51.2-47.5-46-44.4
Tamb 22.4

Note: during the first cooling cycle no ice appears in the drop
during the first melting cycle no plateau appears in T(t)
during the second cooling cycle there are some small peaks in T(t), (maybe) some ice crystals in the drops 
appear but they remain also after the second melting cycle
