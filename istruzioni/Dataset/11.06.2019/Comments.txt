T_0,drop=19.8°C.


2V case
10 ul

RH 50.9-49.8
Tamb 19.6-19.7

Note: during the first cooling cycle nothing happens.


3V case
10 ul

RH 50.9-49.4
Tamb 19.6

Note: during the first cooling cycle the freezing is very rapid and started 
before the stable Peltier temperature was reached.
During the first melting cycle T1<T2 because the drop is changing phase.
Before the second cooling cycle the drop is completely liquid. Also during the second cooling cycle
the freezing phase is rapid.


4V case
10 ul

RH 51.7-50.4-49-48.8
Tamb 19.4-19.6

Note: during the first cooling cycle the freezing is very rapid and started 
before the stable Peltier temperature was reached. It seems that, for this kind of
water, the freezing temperature is around -8°C.
During the first melting cycle T1<T2 because the drop is changing phase and maybe 
this affects the most T1 (phase change should happen at T=const).
Before the second cooling cycle the drop seems completely liquid.
During the second cooling cycle it seems that, for this kind of
water, the freezing temperature is around -9°C (final subcooling 
temperature=-15°C).
During the second melting cycle the T behaviour appears more irregular.

6V case
10 ul

RH 50.5-49.1-48.3
Tamb 19.5-19.6

Note: during the first cooling cycle the freezing is very rapid and it seems
that -10°C is the freezing temperature of this kind of water. The ultimate T 
subcooling = -17°C.

7V case
10 ul

RH 49.9
Tamb 19.6

Note:

------------

2V case

RH 51-50.7-50-49.3-48.4
Tamb 19.6-19.7

Note:

3V case
20 ul

RH 50.9-49-48.8
Tamb 19.6

Note: during the first cycle it seems that T_freezing=-6°C more or less 
(T_ultimate subcooling=-11°C).
The second cooling cycle starts with a bit of ice at the top of the drop 
(Tfreez=-4°C, Tultimate subcooling=-5°C).

4V case
20 ul, T0=20°C

RH 50.6-49.7-48.5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
Tamb 19.5-19.6

Note: during the first cooling cycle freezing starts from the bottom.
At the beginning of the second cooling cycle ice was still in the drop.


6V case
20 ul, T0=20°C

RH 51.5-50.8-49-48.3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Tamb 19.6-19.7

Note: during the first cooling phase ice starts to form on the bottom.
At the beginning of the second cooling cycle ice was still in the drop.


7V case

RH 50.5-49.3-48.7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Tamb 19.5-19.6

Note: during the first cooling cycle ice starts to form from the bottom gradually
(Tfreezing=-9°C more or less).
At the beginning of the second cooling cycle ice was still in the drop.
