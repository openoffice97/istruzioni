System 1

2V case
RH 46.6-47.1
Tamb 20.9


Comparison system 1(with graphene), 2(without graphene) and 3(without graphene and with 
new thermocouples) without any drop.

Cooling time 200s, time P Off 200s

System 1
2V case
RH 48.8-48-47.6
Tamb 20.3-20.4

Note: the surface is dry (also compressor was used). The impulsive response of T can be due to
condensation and freezing of vapour particles (relativly high hulidity) somewhere on the prepreg 
plate or just near graphene sheet; this could be used in order to detect ice formation using the
high graphene thermal conductivity (graphene net).
During the first melting cycle there is a melting region, wich means that somewhere ice was 
formed. 


3V case
RH 49.3-48.1-47
Tamb 20.3-20.4

Note:


4V case
RH 48.7-46.3-45.3
Tamb 20.2-20.3

Note:


6V case
RH 47.5-46-46.8
Tamb 20.2-20.4

Note:


7V case
RH 46.3
Tamb 20.4

Note:


2V case, 3drops of salty water
RH 46-45-44.6-44
Tamb 20.9

Note: during the first cooling cycle the first peak does not correspond 
to ice formaion inside the drop.

During the second cooling cycle the first peak does not correspond 
to ice formaion inside the drop, also because T2>T1 and it means that the 
phenomenon is closer to T2.

3V case, 3drops of salty water
RH 49.6-50.2
Tamb 20.6

Note:

4V case, 3drops of salty water
RH 46.2-45.6
Tamb 20.7-20.8

Note: during the cooling cycles there are always 2 impulses of T(t); the first one is problably
due to very thin ice sheet formation on the prepreg while the second one is due to the phase 
chenge of the drop.


6V case, 3drops of salty water
RH 46.8-46-44.4-45
Tamb 20.7-20.8

Note: during the first cooling cycle the first "big" temperature impulse is due to ice formation
inside the drop.
