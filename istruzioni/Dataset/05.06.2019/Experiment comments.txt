At the beginning the plate was completely wet due to condensation and it has been dryied.


(drop putted few seconds before Peltier ON)
5 drops of normal water
T0_drop=7.2deg
-2V case
RH 59.3-57.8-56.4
Tamb 21.8-21.9

Note: during the cooling cycles a small divergence of T1 and T2 is present. This can be due 
to ice formation in some small regions not visible with naked eyes. Durind the second cooling cycle 
some nucleation effect is present inside the drop.

During the second melting cycle some drops are present on the prepreg.
 

(drop putted few seconds before Peltier ON)
5 drops of normal water
T0_drop=7.2deg
-4V case
RH 59.9-56.6
Tamb 21.7-21.9

Note: during the first cooling cycle the first impulse of T corresponds to something
not visible, but the second one corresponds to ice formation on a lateral slice of the drop
(right one). After that ice starts to form on the bottom lateral sides and rises.

During the first melting cycle some small drops are present on the prepreg.

The second cooling cycle starts with some ice still inside the drop. The T impulse is due to 
ice formation on a ordinate slice on the drop side. (There is a small variation due to Agilent
error).

During the second melting cycle some small drops are present on the prepreg.


(drop putted few seconds before Peltier ON)
5 drops of normal water
T0_drop=7.3deg
-7V case
RH 57.4-55.5-53-51.7
Tamb 21.9-22

Note: during the firts cooling cycle the T impulse (big) is due to ice formation of almost all 
the drop surface. A very strange thing is that the minimum T reached by thermocouples is around -7 or -8 deg
while usually for 7V we reach -20 or similar T.

The T impulse during the second cooling cycle is due to a big anular slice turning into ice.
