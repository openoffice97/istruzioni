2 drops of normal water
-3V case
RH 45-43.2
Tamb 21.9

Note: during the first cooling cycle the impulse of T is due to the almost istantaneous 
formation of ice on the lateral region of the drop (circular shape of ice). T1 and T2 become 
very similar when the drop is completely ice
 
During the first melting region the "plateau" of T(t) is very big because is big the amount of
ice turnung into water. This phenomenon seems to start at the bottom (water on the bottom and 
ice on the top)

The second cooling phase started with ice still at the top. In this case seems that the ice formation 
was more caotic (small nuclei formation inside the drop) until the drop became completely ice

During the second melting cycle water started to form at the bottom (water+ice at the top)

 
2 drops of normal water
-4V case
RH 49.9-45.1-44.4-43.2
Tamb 21.7-21.9

Note: during the first cooling cycle the temperature impulse is due to ice formation of a slice of drop.
There is also something similar to thermal noise that can be due to small regions in which there is 
water-->ice

The second cooling phase starts with ice still at the top. Also in this case small impulses appear 
(maybe small ice nuclei formation)


2 drops of normal water
-6V case
RH 51-47.3-46.3-45.7-43.6
Tamb 21.9-22.1

Note: during the first cooling cycle the temperature impulse is due to ice formation of a slice of drop.
There is also something similar to thermal noise that can be due to small regions in which there is 
water-->ice. When the drop is completely ice T1 and T2 are basically superposed

During the first melting cycle water starts to form on the bottom. On the top the surface is more reflective 
but there is still ice

The second cooling phase starts with ice still at the top.



2 drops of normal water
-7V case
RH 51.1-49.5-48-46.3-45.9-44.4
Tamb 22-22.1

Note: during the first cooling cycle the temperature impulse is due to ice formation of 
a slice of drop.

The second cooling phase starts with ice still at the top. During the cycle seems that 
no ice nuclei are formed (no thermal noise). During the last part of the phase some small
impulses are  present probably because of the formation of small ice filaments on the drop.


(drop putted few seconds before Peltier ON)
5 drops of normal water
-2V case
RH 49.5-47.4
Tamb 22-22.1

Note: during the first cooling cycle there is a thermal noise but nothing seems to happen. The same 
effect is present during the first melting cycle.

The second cooling cycle is a bit noisy but nothing happened.
 


(drop putted few seconds before Peltier ON)
5 drops of normal water
-3V case
RH 47-46.3-45.4
Tamb 22-22.1

Note: during the first cooling phase ice appears just on the bottom sides of the drop.

Before the second cooling phase some "nuclei" were present. 

(drop putted few seconds before Peltier ON)
5 drops of normal water
-4V case
RH 51.2-48.6-47-46-46.8
Tamb 22-22.1

Note: during the first cooling cycle the T impulse appears because a region on the side 
of the drop turned into ice

The second cooling phase starts with ice inside the drop (central-top). In this cycle no slices
of ice appear (quite slow freezing)

Note: in the second cooling cycle a perturbation of the system is used.

10 drops of normal water
T0_drop=23.7deg
-3V case
RH 57.2-52.9
Tamb 22.6-22.8

Note: during the first cooling cycle the impulse of T is due to a large area of the 
drop surface on which we have water->ice (not on the bottom at first).

(drop putted few seconds before Peltier ON)
10 drops of normal water
T0_drop=23.5deg
-4V case
RH 57.7-51.7-50-48.1
Tamb 22.6-22.8-22.9

Note:during the first cooling cycle just the bottom side region of the drop gives the 
impulse for T and then the freezing process continue gradually

The second cooling cycle starts with ice still inside the drop.


(drop putted few seconds before Peltier ON)
10 drops of normal water
T0_drop=23.6deg
-6V case
RH 56.1-50.8-49.7-47.5-46.4
Tamb 22.6-22.9

Note:during the first cooling cycle ice starts to form in the bottom side region. The freezing 
process continues gradually from the bottom to the top until the drop turns completely in ice.

The second cooling cycle starts with ice still inside the drop, just the bottom part is of water.

-7V case
RH 56-52.5-51-49.4-48.1-47-47.2
Tamb 22.8-23

Note: during the first cooling cycle the T impulse is due to ice formation just on the bottom
side layer (drop-plate contact region) and freezing process continues gradually.

During the first melting cycle small droplets of water are on the plate.

The second cooling cycle starts with ice still inside the drop, just the bottom part is of water.
